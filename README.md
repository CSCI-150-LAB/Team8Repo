# Project Description: 

 MyCar is an Android OS mobile based software application that allows a customer to securely log in and rent a vehicle directly from a dealership based on their personal preferences for the purpose of entertainment and/or transportation. The software is for usage with consumers who either don't own a vehicle and need transportation, or for consumers who already own a vehicle but want to drive something different for the purpose of testing (in the event of new car shopping), pleasure, or business. 

# Features implemented for User, Dealer, Admin: 

 For this app, we created a home page in which the app user can access his/her information as User, Dealer, and Admin. For User, Dealer, and Admin, they all can login to access their dashboards or logout out of their dashboards. If they donâ€™t have an account, they can register by clicking on the Register button of the Login forms provided. If they forgot the password for any reason, they have the option of filling out the form in which they are able to reclaim the password. 

User: Settings, Search, Select, Contact, Shopping Cart, Orders, Calendar, Profile, Logout

Dealer: Search, Inventory, Reservation, Logout

Admin: Modify Fees, Modify Users, Logout

# Languages/Technologies: 

Java, XML, Android Studio, SQLite, Firebase
